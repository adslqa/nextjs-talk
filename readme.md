#Universal React Apps Using Next.js

These are the code samples that I used in my talk "Universal React Apps using Next.js". The `master` branch contains all the code, but you can also check out the `step-x` branches for each step presented:

- `step-0`: Initializing a new Next.js application
- `step-1`: Creating the index route and page
- `step-2`: Creating additional routes and pages
- `step-0`: Navigation
- `step-0`: Loading data
