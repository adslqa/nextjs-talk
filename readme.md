# Universal React Apps Using Next.js

Every user’s hardware is different, and processing speed can hinder user experience on client-side rendered React applications. Server-side rendering and code-splitting can drastically improve user experience by minimizing the work that the client has to do. It’s easy to get lost in the lingo, so this presentation explores what it all means and how to easily build universal React apps using the Next.js framework. I walk through the concepts and use code examples to cement your understanding. You’ll get the most out of this if you’re comfortable with React and ES6 syntax.

You can find the slides [here](https://speakerdeck.com/siakaramalegos/universal-react-apps-using-next-dot-js).

## Code Samples

These are the code samples that I used in the talk. The `master` branch contains all the code, but you can also check out the `step-x` branches for each step presented:

- `step-0`: Initializing a new Next.js application
- `step-1`: Creating the index route and page
- `step-2`: Creating additional routes and pages
- `step-0`: Navigation
- `step-0`: Loading data
